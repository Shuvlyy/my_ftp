The goal of this project is to create a **FTP server**.

You MUST implement the given protocol (bonuses must be `RFC959` compliant). \
You MUST implement request sequences that are explained in the protocol (more information can be found in `RFC959`).

The network communication will be achieved through the use of TCP sockets.
